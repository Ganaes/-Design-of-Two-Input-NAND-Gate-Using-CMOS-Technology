# Design of Two Input NAND Gate Using CMOS Technology
This repository presents the design of Two Input NAND Gate implemented using Synopsis Custom Compiler. The purpose of this Hackathon is to implement the proposed design in 28 nm PDK (Process Design Kit). As a result of literature survey and Implemantation, this is a final Report Submission for successful completion of  Two Input NAND Gate design and simulation, for Cloud Based Analog IC Design Hackathon.
